Well data:
Note: Well data was the most difficult to come by, provincial websites such as the Ontario provincial site below had the most complete databases. More searching is required.

Errors/Warnings:
“WARNING: Error exit, tauk2. IFAULT = 12” – My understanding of this warning/error is that it occurs for two reasons. One being if there is an insufficient amount of data (eg. n<=3) the MannKendall function will terminate the program. Two being if there is enough data but it determines that the p-values are inaccurate, this will not terminate the program and only give a warning. Further understanding is needed.
